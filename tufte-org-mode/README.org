** Table of contents                                               :noexport:

To include a table of contents when exporting the Org document,
set options ~title:t~ in the document header.

* Introduction

This README covers several aspects of using Org documents for
compilation to Tufte-style books and handouts
via LaTeX and the Tufte-LaTeX package.

The source for this README document is good reference for how to set up and write
an Org document to be exported to a Tufte-style handout.

An additional two template files are provided as a basis for Org documents
to be compiled to a Tufte-style book and handout respectively.

Much of the source here and documentation are adapted from a few sources:
documentation and source for the ~tufte-org-mode~ project [[tufte-ebib:tufte-org-mode]] on Github,
documentation for the ~tufte-latex~ project [[tufte-ebib:tufte-latex]] on Github (and CTAN),
and discussion on StackExchange [[tufte-ebib:tex-stackexchange-45934]]
about using
#+LATEX: {\sc{Bib}\LaTeX}
with ~tufte-latex~ classes in LaTeX.

* Install Notes

#+end_src

** Install Emacs package

The Emacs package at https://github.com/tsdye/tufte-org-mode needs to be installed,
and the directories containing ~ox-tufte-latex.el~ (from the package) and ~org-tufte.el~
(from here) be in the Emacs ~load-path~ variable (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Library-Search.html][documentation]]).

Finally, ~org-tufte.el~ should be loaded via ~(require 'org-tufte)~ during startup or before using the template documents below.

* Template Documents

There are two template documents, one for compiling to handouts (~tufte-handout-template.org~),
and another for compiling to books (~tufte-book-template.org~).

* Compiling Documents

The Org Tufte documents can be compiled to PDF by calling
#+LATEX: \linebreak
~org-export-dispatch~  and exporting to Tufte LaTeX format
(i.e., ~C-c C-e T~ followed by the key corresponding to the desired output).

* Tufte Handout Document 

{{{newthought(These are handout documents)}}} that simulate the layout in Tufte's handouts.

** Document Structure

Handouts only have sections and subsections.
The output PDF file has continuous flow, i.e. no section or subsection begins on a new page.

** Heading Structure

Tufte handout documents have the heading levels: sections, subsections and paragraphs.
(It does not have parts and chapters like Tufte books.)
Sub-subsections and subparagraphs are not defined by default.

From an Org-mode perspective, it only supports three heading levels.
Heading levels more than three deep are treated as numbered lists.

* Tufte Book Documents

{{{newthought(These are book documents)}}} that simulate the layout in Tufte's books.

** Document Structure

Books have a title page, contents page, book parts and chapters within those book parts.
The output PDF file is assembled such that the title page, contents page, each parts page, and the first page of each chapter begins on an odd-numbered page.

** Heading Structure

The heading structure of Tufteâ€™s books has the heading levels: parts, chapters, sections, subsections and paragraphs.

Sub-subsections and subparagraphs are not defined by default and when used will throw an error when compiling the LaTeX output to PDF.

From an Org-mode perspective, it only supports four heading levels.
Heading levels more than four deep are treated as numbered lists and sublists.

* Wide text

To have text extend into the margin, use the ~fullwidth~ environment.

#+begin_fullwidth
Some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really  long text that you want to run into the margin.
#+end_fullwidth

* Tables

{{{newthought(There are three types)}}} of supported table placements.
These are within the text body, within the margin and across the page.

** Text Body Table

Here is an example of a table situated in the text body.

#+name: tab:text-body
#+caption[Example in-text table]: Example table in the text.
#+caption: Note that the caption is placed in the margin.
#+attr_latex: :font \footnotesize
| First | Second | Third | Fourth | Fifth | Sixth |
|-------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------|
| A     | B      | C     | D      | E     | F     |
| G     | H      | I     | J      | K     | L     |

** Margin Table

Here is an example of a table situated in the margin.
We can control the offset to situate the margin table accordingly.

#+name: tab:marginal
#+caption[Example marginal table]: Example marginal table.
#+caption: Note that the table and the caption are placed in the margin.
#+attr_latex: :booktabs nil :font \footnotesize :float margin :offset -0.75in
| First | Second | Third |
|-------+--------+-------|
| A     | B      | C     |
| D     | E      | F     |

** Full-width Table

Here is an example of a table that is centered on the page,
that is allowed to span up to the full width of the page.
Note that when the automatic caption placement can be suboptimal,
so it can be better to define an offset for it as is done in this example.

#+name: tab:full-width
#+caption[Example full width table][0.2in]: Example full width table.
#+caption: Note that the caption is placed in the margin.
#+attr_latex: :font \footnotesize :float multicolumn
| First | Second | Third | Fourth | Fifth | Sixth | Seventh | Eighth | Ninth |
|-------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+---------+--------+-------|
| A     | B      | C     | D      | E     | F     | G       | H      | I     |
| J     | K      | L     | M      | N     | O     | P       | Q      | R     |

* Figures

{{{newthought(Figure placement possibilities)}}} are similar those available for tables.
These are within the text body, within the margin and across the page.

** Text Body Figure

Here is an example of a figure situated in the text body.
In this example, the ~:vertical-alignment~ LaTeX attribute is set to ~t~ to align the caption to the top of the image,
but it can be set to ~b~ to align the caption to the bottom of the image instead.

#+name: fig:text-body
#+caption[Kaplan-Meier curve]: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan%E2%80%93Meier_estimator][Kaplan-Meier curve]].  
#+caption: This figure only takes up the width of the text body.
#+caption: The caption in the margin is set to align with the top of the image.
#+attr_latex: :vertical-alignment t
[[file:kaplan-meier-estimator.png]]

** Margin Figure

Here is an example of a figure situated in the margin.
We can control the offset to situate the margin table accordingly.

#+name: fig:marginal
#+caption[Kaplan-Meier curve]: The same Kaplan-Meier curve.
#+caption: This figure fits in the margin.
#+caption: An offset can be provided to adjust the position.
#+attr_latex: :float margin :width 2in :offset -5.0in
[[file:kaplan-meier-estimator.png]]

** Full-width Figure

Here is an example of a figure that is centered on the page,
that is allowed to span up to the full width of the page.

#+name: fig:full-width
#+caption[Density plot]: This density plot shows the distribution of two random variables.
#+caption: The figure takes up the full page width.
#+attr_latex: :float multicolumn
[[file:distribution-density.png]]

* References

As an example, here is a reference to one of Edward Tufte's books.[[tufte-ebib:10.5555/33404]]

You can also do references another way, like this: see [[tufte-ebib:10.5555/33404][Tufte, Edward R. (1986)]].

** ebib

If you currently use ~ebib~, this document and the template documents have a default setup for it.

Specifically, the file-local variables in these files define a new link type ~tufte-ebib~ that creates
margin citations that are used in Tufte's books and handouts.
(The technical details are that the ~tufte-ebib~ links export the reference to use the
LaTeX ~\autocite{}~ command, for which we've set up ~biblatex~ to output to footnotes,
which are automatically put in the margins by the ~tufte-latex~ classes.)

After ~ebib~ is opened and a BibTeX file is loaded into it, the
#+LATEX: \linebreak
~ebib-insert-citation~ command can be used to insert ~tufte-ebib~ links.

Note that ~ebib~ needs to be opened with the corresponding BibTeX file for this document
in order to export the references.
It should match file referenced in the ~\addbibresource~ LaTeX header at the top of this document
source.

** Directly Citing References

Otherwise, references can be directly cited using the ~\cite{}~ (for in-text citations)
and ~\autocite{}~ (for margin citations) commands.
The bibliography keys the commands are called with should match BibTeX entry keys in the file
loaded in the ~\addbibresource~ LaTeX header at the top of this document source.

* Macros

Here are some Org macros that expand to ~tufte-latex~ TeX package commands (see [[https://ctan.org/pkg/tufte-latex?lang=en][documentation]]).
They are defined at the top of this document, and are also pre-defined in the template files.

Org macros are typically used within the Org document as follows:
#+begin_src org :eval none
{{{macroname(arg1,arg2,...)}}}
#+end_src

The above calls the macro ~macroname~ with three arguments ~arg1~, ~arg2~, ~arg3~, and so on.
When the value for an argument is not given, it is simply substituted with an empty string.

Commas within an argument should be escaped (~\,~), for example

#+begin_example
{{{sidenote(This is a macro\, called with two args,0pt)}}}
#+end_example

** newthought

{{{newthought(This macro sets the first part)}}} of the first sentence in a new section to small-caps,
using the ~\newthought~ command in ~tufte-latex~.

#+begin_src org
,#+MACRO: newthought \newthought{$1}
#+end_src

** sidenote

This macro creates a numbered sidenote
{{{sidenote(This sidenote is numbered\, and has a comma.,0pt)}}},
using the ~\sidenote~ command in ~tufte-latex~.

#+begin_src org
,#+MACRO: sidenote \sidenote[$2][$3]{$1}
#+end_src

Specifically, the macro has the following signature, where ~text~ is the sidenote text, ~offset~ is the vertical offset for the sidenote position (e.g. ~0pt~, ~1.0in~ or  ~2.0cm~), and ~number~ is an override for the sidenote number.
Overriding the sidenote number will only change the number for that sidenote,
and will not affect the sequence of subsequent sidenotes.

#+begin_src org :eval none
{{{sidenote(text,offset,number)}}}
#+end_src

Note that regular footnotes get translated into sidenotes even without this macro.[fn:1]

Sidenotes can be italicized by starting the ~text~ argument with the LaTeX ~\it~ command.
{{{sidenote(\it Sidenotes can be italicized\, like this.,0pt)}}}
They can be similarly bolded using the ~\bf~ command.
{{{sidenote(\bf They can also be bolded\, like this.,0pt)}}}
It is also possible to both bold and italicize the side note.
{{{sidenote(\bf \itshape Or both\, like this.,0pt)}}}

** marginnote

This macro creates an unnumbered sidenote
{{{marginnote(This marginnote is unnumbered.,0pt)}}},
otherwise called a margin note, using the ~\marginnote~ command in ~tufte-latex~.

#+begin_src org
,#+MACRO: marginnote \marginnote[$2]{$1}
#+end_src

Specifically, the macro has the following signature, where ~text~ is the margin note text,
and ~offset~ is the vertical offset for the margin note position (e.g. ~0pt~, ~1.0in~ or  ~2.0cm~).

#+begin_src org :eval none
{{{marginnote(text,offset)}}}
#+end_src

Like sidenotes, margin notes can also be italicized{{{marginnote(\it Margin notes can be italicized\, like this.,0pt)}}},
bolded{{{marginnote(\bf Or bolded\, like this.,0pt)}}},
or both{{{marginnote(\bf \itshape Or both\, like this.,0pt)}}}.

To italicize margin notes by default, modify the macro definition to include ~\it~ before ~$1~.

#+begin_src org
,#+MACRO: marginnote \marginnote[$2]{\it $1}
#+end_src
